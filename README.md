# Advent Of Code 2018 :santa::christmas_tree:

My solutions for the 2018 Advent of Code problems.

I used **Python** as a way to practice my skills with that language.

I was only able to take the challenges up to Day 14, but it was a lot of fun! I loved the challenges and learned new things.
Next year I will try to make time to keep up until the last one!
